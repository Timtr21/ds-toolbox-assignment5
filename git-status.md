# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is used to display the current state of the working directory and staging area. It shows:
- Which changes are staged for the next commit.
- Which files are modified but not yet staged.
- Any untracked files in the working directory.

In JupyterLab IDE, you can access similar information through the Git panel, which visually displays the status of files in terms of changes, staging, and untracked files.
